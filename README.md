# Calculus Visualizer Web App

This is a modern web-based version of an old source code for applets ( by David J. Eck as seen at the end of this file) that I found searching the internet.
The applet source code can still be run with Java jdk's 8-17.
We built the web-based version using HTML5 Canvas and Math.js together
with Cline AI editor using DeepSeek and Gemini 3 preview LLMS.

## How to Run

Simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.

## Features

- **Interactive Graphing**: Visualize functions and their derivatives
- **Tangent Line**: Drag the slider to see the tangent line move along the curve
- **Symbolic Math**: Automatically calculates the derivative formula
- **Examples**: Includes several example functions (cubic, sine, exponential, etc.)
- **Clean Interface**: Modern, responsive design suitable for students

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5 Canvas**: For high-performance graphing
- **Math.js**: For parsing mathematical expressions and calculating derivatives
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Lightweight and easy to understand

## Customization

You can edit js files to change default ranges (`X_MIN`, `X_MAX`, etc.) or add more features.
